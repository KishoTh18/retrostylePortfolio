About

Hi, I’m Pathmanathan Krishogaran — an IT undergraduate with a creative mind and a passionate heart.

By profession, I’m a Web Developer, skilled in building MERN stack, PHP & MySQL-based projects and always exploring new technologies. I enjoy turning ideas into real, working solutions that make life easier and better.

But beyond the code, I’m also a Public Speaker and a strong believer in personal development. I read, meditate, and speak to inspire others — especially students — to grow in mindset, confidence, and self-awareness. I’ve started building a vision-driven team to share practical tools for life success, beyond the classroom.

Whether it’s solving tech problems or life challenges, I’m all about learning, evolving, and helping others grow too.

Let’s build something meaningful — in code or in character.
✓ Highlight my dual roles as Web Developer and Public Speaker
✓ Add beautiful animations and visual elements to the About section
